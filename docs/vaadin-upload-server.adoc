[[vaadin-upload.server]]

= Server Communication

== Background

The [elementname]#vaadin-upload# element sends a [classname]#FormData# via [classname]#XMLHttpRequest#.
The encoding type used is `multipart/form-data` which has been the standard way to upload files for ages, hence it is supported by almost servers.
Since this type only can be sent using the method `POST` or `PUT`, we only support those.

In order to support simultaneous uploads, instead of reusing the same `FormData` and `XHR` we create a new one for each file, so it's alright if the server only considers receiving one file per request.

Although we don't support other encoding types, in future versions [elementname]#vaadin-upload# will be able to send encoded files as parameters in normal Ajax requests, obviously there will be size limitations, and will not be the optimal way to upload files but an alternative.

For the client side we use the [classname]#ProgressEvent# specification, available in all modern browsers.

== Request Configuration.

The communication between [elementname]#vaadin-upload# element and server side can be totally configured using  element properties or attributes, and events.

=== Configuration properties

[width="100%", options="header"]
|======================
|Property name | default value | description
| target | '' |Â Server URL
| method | POST | HTTP Method used to send the files. Only POST and PUT are allowed.
| headers | {} | A JSON map with key/values to send to the server in the `Headers`
| timeout | 0 | Time limit in seconds to upload the file
|======================

[source,html]

<vaadin-upload
  target="http://127.0.0.1:8080/upload/servlet.gupld"
  method="POST"
  accept="image/*,video/*"
  headers="{'Accept': 'application/json'}"
  timeout=15000
></vaadin-upload>
----

=== Configuring the request via Events

There are certain events to modify the `XHR` before sending it, or the `response` when the request finishes.

- `upload-before`: At this point the `XHR` has not been opened yet, but you can set the servlet URL changing the attribute [propertyname]#file.uploadTarget#. You could also reject the file at this point if you prevent default.

[source,javascript]
----
  uploader.addEventListener('upload-before', function(e) {
    e.detail.file.uploadTarget =
      'http://127.0.0.1:8080/upload/servlet.gupld?filename=' + e.detail.file.name;
  });

  uploader.addEventListener('upload-before', function(e) {
    if (e.detail.file.size > 10240) {
      e.detail.file.error = 'File too big.'
    }
  });
----

- `upload-request`: You can change request parameters before it is sent, or prevent default.

[source,javascript]
----
  uploader.addEventListener('upload-request', function(e) {
    e.detail.xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');
  });
----

- `upload-response` can be used when the server message was received, and before the component processes it.
  At this point, you can check the response and make the upload fail setting the [propertyname]#file.error# property.

[source,javascript]
----
  uploader.addEventListener('upload-response', function(e) {
    if (e.detail.xhr.status == 200) {
      e.detail.file.error = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText).error;
    }
  });
