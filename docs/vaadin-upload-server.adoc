[[vaadin-upload.server]]

= Server Communication

== Background

The [elementname]#vaadin-upload# element sends a [classname]#FormData# via an [classname]#XMLHttpRequest#.
The encoding type used is `multipart/form-data`. It has been the standard way to upload files for ages, hence it is supported by almost all servers.
Since this type can only be sent using the POST or PUT methods, we only support those.

In order to support simultaneous uploads, instead of reusing the same [classname]#FormData# and [classname]#XMLHttpRequest#, we create a new one for each file. It is therefore alright for the server to only consider receiving one file per request.

For the client-side, we use the [classname]#ProgressEvent# specification, available in all modern browsers.

== Request Configuration.

Communication between the [elementname]#vaadin-upload# element and the server-side can be completely configured using element properties or attributes, and events.

=== Configuration Properties

[width="100%", options="header"]
|======================
|Property name | Default value | Description
| [propertyname]#target# | `''` |Â Server URL
| [propertyname]#method# | `POST` | HTTP method used to send the files. Only POST and PUT are allowed.
| [propertyname]#headers# | `{}` | A JSON map with key/values to send to the server in the `Headers`
| [propertyname]#timeout# | `0` | Time limit in seconds to upload the file
|======================

<vaadin-upload
  target="http://127.0.0.1:8080/upload/servlet.gupld"
  method="POST"
  accept="image/*,video/*"
  headers="{'Accept': 'application/json'}"
  timeout=15000
></vaadin-upload>

=== Configuring the Request with Events

There are certain events to modify the XHR before sending it, or the `response` when the request finishes.

`upload-before`:: At this point, the XHR has not been opened yet, but you can set the server URL by setting the [propertyname]#file.uploadTarget# attribute.
You can also reject the file at this point by preventing the default action.
+
[source,javascript]
----
uploader.addEventListener('upload-before', function(e) {
  e.detail.file.uploadTarget =
    'http://127.0.0.1:8080/upload/servlet.gupld?filename=' + e.detail.file.name;
});

uploader.addEventListener('upload-before', function(e) {
  if (e.detail.file.size > 10240) {
    e.detail.file.error = 'File too big.'
  }
});
----

`upload-request`:: You can change the request headers before it is sent and append data keys to the request.
+
[source,javascript]
----
uploader.addEventListener('upload-request', function(e) {
  e.detail.xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');
  e.detail.formData.append('documentId', 1234);
});
----
+
You can cancel sending the request to the server by calling [methodname]#event.preventDefault()#.
In this case, you can send the request manually.
This allows you to upload the file directly in the request data instead of inside a FormData wrapper.
+
[source,javascript]
----
uploader.addEventListener('upload-request', function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.detail.xhr.send(e.detail.file);
});
----

`upload-response`:: The event is dispatched when the server message was received, but before the component processes it.
At this point, you can check the response and make the upload fail by setting the [propertyname]#file.error# property.
If the event is default-prevented, the response is not checked for errors and the UI is not updated.
+
[source,javascript]
----
uploader.addEventListener('upload-response', function(e) {
  if (e.detail.xhr.status == 200) {
    e.detail.file.error = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText).error;
  }
});
