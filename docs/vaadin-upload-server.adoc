[[vaadin-upload.server]]

= Server Communication

== Background

The [elementname]#vaadin-upload# element sends a [classname]#FormData# via [classname]#XMLHttpRequest#.
The encoding type used is `multipart/form-data`. It has been the standard way to upload files for ages, hence it is supported by almost all servers.
Since this type can only be sent using the POST or PUT methods, we only support those.

In order to support simultaneous uploads, instead of reusing the same [classname]#FormData# and [classname]#XHR#, we create a new one for each file. It is therefore alright for the server to only consider receiving one file per request.

For the client-side we use the [classname]#ProgressEvent# specification, available in all modern browsers.

== Request Configuration.

The Communication between [elementname]#vaadin-upload# element and server-side can be completely configured using element properties or attributes, and events.

=== Configuration Properties

[width="100%", options="header"]
|======================
|Property name | Default value | Description
| [propertyname]#target# | `''` |Â Server URL
| [propertyname]#method# | `POST` | HTTP method used to send the files. Only POST and PUT are allowed.
| [propertyname]#headers# | `{}` | A JSON map with key/values to send to the server in the `Headers`
| [propertyname]#timeout# | `0` | Time limit in seconds to upload the file
|======================

[source,html]

<vaadin-upload
  target="http://127.0.0.1:8080/upload/servlet.gupld"
  method="POST"
  accept="image/*,video/*"
  headers="{'Accept': 'application/json'}"
  timeout=15000
></vaadin-upload>

=== Configuring the request via Events

There are certain events to modify the `XHR` before sending it, or the `response` when the request finishes.

upload-before:: At this point the XHR has not been opened yet, but you can set the server URL changing the attribute [propertyname]#file.uploadTarget#. You could also reject the file at this point if you prevent default.

[source,javascript]
----
  uploader.addEventListener('upload-before', function(e) {
    e.detail.file.uploadTarget =
      'http://127.0.0.1:8080/upload/servlet.gupld?filename=' + e.detail.file.name;
  });

  uploader.addEventListener('upload-before', function(e) {
    if (e.detail.file.size > 10240) {
      e.detail.file.error = 'File too big.'
    }
  });
----

upload-request:: You can change request parameters before it is sent, or prevent default to avoid the request be sent to the server.


[source,javascript]
----
  uploader.addEventListener('upload-request', function(e) {
    e.detail.xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');
  });
----

upload-response:: can be used when the server message was received, and before the component processes it.
  At this point, you can check the response and make the upload fail setting the [propertyname]#file.error# property.
  Also you can prevent default so as response is not checked for errors and the UI is not updated.

[source,javascript]
----
  uploader.addEventListener('upload-response', function(e) {
    if (e.detail.xhr.status == 200) {
      e.detail.file.error = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText).error;
    }
  });
