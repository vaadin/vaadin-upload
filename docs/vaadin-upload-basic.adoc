[[vaadin-upload.example]]
= Basic Usage

The user can select files to upload by using the file selector in the browser or by dropping the files from the desktop into the component.
The developer can customize validations by using element attributes, or programmatically using the JavaScript API.

[source,html]
----
<vaadin-upload target="http://foo.bar/upload"></vaadin-upload>
----

== Events

The [vaadinelement]#vaadin-upload# element dispatches events when files are added, removed or rejected, and for every upload state change for each file.
You can use the events for either changing the behavior of the process, or for preventing default actions.
For a complete list of events and their descriptions, please refer to the API documentation.

=== Event Details
All events contain the [classname]#File# object in the [propertyname]#event.detail.file# property.
Additionally, upload events also have a [propertyname]#event.detail.xhr# property with the corresponding [classname]#XMLHttpRequest# instance.

In the following example, we listen to `file-add` events, which are fired whenever the user adds a new file to the queue:

[source,javascript]
----
var upload = document.querySelector('vaadin-upload');
upload.addEventListener('file-add', function(e) {
  alert(event.detail.file.name + ' was added');
});
----

When using the element inside another Polymer element, you can use the declarative binding syntax to subscribe for an event:

[source,html]
----
<dom-module id="my-element">
  <template>
    <vaadin-upload on-file-add="fileAdded"></vaadin-upload>
  </template>
</dom-module>
<script>
  Polymer({
    is: 'my-element',
    fileAdded: function(event) {
      alert(event.detail.file.name + ' was added');
    }
  });
</script>
