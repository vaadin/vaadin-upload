== Modifying the content

[elementname]#vaadin-upload# provides content composition through the element's light DOM.

There are two modifiable parts, the content with the drop label placed before the file list, and the part after the file list.
The first part must be marked with the class name `drop-label`, whereas the second one is composed with the remaining element content.
Right now it's not possible to customize the file list using templates, but will be possible soon.

Here you have an example of how to modify them:

[source,html]
----
<vaadin-upload >
  <div class="drop-label">
    Drop your documents here.
  </div>
  <!-- File list is here -->
  <div>
    Accepts up to 3 PDF files, up to 1MB each
  </div>
  <!-- Buttons go here -->
</vaadin-upload>
